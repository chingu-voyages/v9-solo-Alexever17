The mythical beings will choose their summoners on their 14th birthday and give them a stigma. Schools have been set up to train summoners and magical swordsman (basically bodyguards that give the summoners time to cast their spell) as a result. 15 years later after the finding of magic Kazuki Hayashizaki is chosen as a summoner and given a stigma to indicate that. This is surprising since males aren’t chosen as summoners due to their low amount of mana compared to females. As the first male to be a summoner Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone. To complicate matters his sister (who’s a magical swordsman) is against him going into summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman have a cat mouse thing going on where summoners look down on magical swordsman as inferior so his sister naturally is against him going there. She’ll stop him even if it means going to war. Kazuki however is determined to thrive in summoner school and has already determined to give it his all. Even if he’s the lowest ranked student (ranked E) and his fellow students intend to demean him he’ll prove himself as the strongest summoner.",

There was an endless void, and within the emptiness there was a self-proclaimed Ruler of Light — a dim globe of light. “Link, are you willing to save the continent of Feiloma from the envelopment of darkness?” the Ruler of Light asked. Of course, in reality, Link wouldn’t dream of agreeing to such a taxing mission. However, couldn’t he give it a shot in the game? “I am willing!” Link replied in deadly earnest. “Then go ahead.” And thus, Link was thrown into the miserable continent of Feiloma.",
